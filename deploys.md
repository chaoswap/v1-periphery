# Deployment addresses

The latest version of `@chaoswap/v1-core`, `@chaoswap/v1-periphery` are deployed to Ethereum mainnet and all testnets
at the same addresses.

The source code is verified with Etherscan on all networks, for all contracts except `ChaoswapV1Pool`.
We are working on getting the `ChaoswapV1Pool` contract verified with Etherscan.

These addresses are final and were deployed from these npm package versions:

- `@chaoswap/v1-core`: [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/chaoswap/v1-core/tree/v1.0.0)
- `@chaoswap/v1-periphery`: [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/chaoswap/v1-periphery/tree/v1.0.0)
